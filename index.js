// probably going to be doing an inquirer.prompt() here

// create an array called employees

// whenever a new employee's info is added, we can then create a new employee object and push it to the employees array.

// create a function called askEmployeeInfo()
// this function will prompt the user for the following information:
// name, id, email, and role
// depending on the role, we will prompt the user for more information. github (engineer), office number(manager), and school (intern)
// when all that information is collected then we can create a new employee object and push it to the employees array.
// after we push to the employees array, we can then ask the user if they want to add another employee.
// if they answer yes, we can call the askEmployeeInfo() function again.
// if they answer no, we can then call the makeHTML() function.

// when the user selects "I am done" then we can then loop through the employees array and print out the information for each employee into an html document.

WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineerâ€™s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have:

github // GitHub username

getGithub()

getRole() // Overridden to return 'Engineer'
